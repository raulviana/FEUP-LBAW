# A3: User Interface Prototype
The ArtNow platform allows its users to search and manage events.

This user interfaces prototype (or horizontal prototype) has the following goals:

1. Help to identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones;
2. Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed;
3. Enable quick and multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

There is a general description of the application interface and the common features
 of all pages. After that, through a sitemap, we provide an overview of the information system from the viewpoint of the user. Finally, using storyboards, there is an identification of the main interactions with the system.


## 1. Interface and common features


**ArtNow** is a web site built upon HTML5, PHP and JavaScript technologies. It's developed with BootStrap4 framework and intended to be very user-friendly.

The user interface is slightly different across different display sizes, so the next table summarizes the key user interface features in two different display sizes.

| Caption | Desktop | Mobile |

| **1** | Navigation Bar | Collapsed Links |
| **2** | LogIn and SignUp Links | SearchBar and *Tags* |

Figure 2: Event User Interface

The event user interface is the same in desktop and in mobile versions, except for the displacement of the responsive elements. 

**1 -** options for interested users. Possibilities are: adding the event to the user wishlist, inform the attendance and buy tickets.

**2 -** three options to visualize: info about the event, the event posts, and the selected related posts.

**3 -** section with more extended event information.

**4 -** several links to different social media.

**5 -** links to event creators, sponsors and partnerships user profile pages.


To enhance usability, the login and signup pages are designed as pop-ups within the home page as can be seen in figures 2 and 3.

There are some common features across all pages to homogenize the user experience. 
The **navbar** and the **footer** are common across all pages. The **search bar** and its **tags** are also common to all pages. It was chosen the Bootstrap dark template and the photos were chosen to accommodate smoothly with the color palette.
